# Functional Programming, React, and Compilers with ReasonML

These are the slides I gave for a talk at [this](https://www.meetup.com/Chicago-ReasonML/events/vvwszqybcgbcb) ReasonML monthly meetup.

A recording of the talk can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m7GUlukBpwNsSE0jqna2Jpq5bRq2F1n6/view?usp=sharing). Please let me know your feedback!

This project was made with MDX Deck and Code Surfer, and the compiler implementation was inspired by Gary Bernhardt's introductory course on compilers (Destroy All Software), which can be found [here](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/a-compiler-from-scratch).
